      <h3>The Spider</h3>
      <p>

        Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics. He
        first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books.

        The real identity of Spiderman is Peter Parker, an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after
        the death of his parents in a plane crash.

      <p>
        Peter Parker is an high-school student at Midtown High School. During a science exhibit he is bitten by a radioactive spider
        and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid". Along with super strength, Parker gains the
        ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him
        fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels.

        Initially, Peter uses these abilities for stardom, but after letting a burglar escape who is responsible for shooting his
        uncle, he learns to use his power to fight crime.
